# STEP 4: DEFINE THE PROBLEM TYPE
#------------------------------------------------------

# define the problem as an optimization to maximize the objective function
prob = pulp.LpProblem("StudentClass", pulp.LpMaximize)

# STEP 5: SETUP DECISION VARIABLES
#------------------------------------------------------

# start off by making a simple list of coordinates for decision variables, in the format (i, j) 
# where "i" indicates the  student number and "j" indicates the activity number:
decision_var_matrix = []
for i in range(NUM_STUDENTS):
    for j in range(NUM_ACTIVITIES):
        decision_var_matrix.append((i, j))
# at this point, decision_var_matrix = [(0, 0), (0, 1) ... (0, 11), (1, 0), (1, 1), etc...]

# now setup a set of decision variables, one for each period
decision_vars_list = []
for i in range(NUM_PERIODS):

    decision_vars_list.append(pulp.LpVariable.dicts(variable_type_name, decision_var_matrix, 
                                                    0, 1, pulp.LpBinary))

# We now have one set of decision variables for each period. Think of each set of decision 
# variables as an m-by-n matrix of binary (1 or 0) values where 'm' is the number of students and 
# 'n' is the number of activities. For the given period, a value of 1 indicates that the student 
# is in that activity in that period and a value of 0 means they are not. 

# STEP 6: SETUP CONSTRAINTS
#------------------------------------------------------

# CONSTRAINT 1: each student must be in one and only one activity per period
for decision_vars in decision_vars_list:
    for i in range(NUM_STUDENTS):
        vars_to_sum = [decision_vars[(i, j)] for j in range(NUM_ACTIVITIES)]

    for j in range(NUM_ACTIVITIES):
        vars_to_sum = [decision_vars[(i, j)] for decision_vars in decision_vars_list]
        prob += pulp.lpSum(vars_to_sum) <= 1

# CONSTRAINT 3: each activity must have a minimum number of students
for decision_vars in decision_vars_list:
    for j in range(NUM_ACTIVITIES):
        vars_to_sum = [decision_vars[(i, j)] for i in range(NUM_STUDENTS)]

# CONSTRAINT 5: each student must get 3 of their 4 choices
for i in range(NUM_STUDENTS):
    # remember, student_info_dicts[i]['choices'] looks like [x1, x2, x3, x4] where
    # x1...x4 are the activity numbers for the student's first through fourth  
    # choices respectively

# STEP 6: SETUP OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
#------------------------------------------------------

# The objective function is gonna give 1000 "points" for each 1st choice match made, 
# 100 for each second choice, 10 for each third choice and 1 for each fourth choice.
# To do this, for each set of decision variables, we iterate through each student 
# and get their choices. For each choice, the corresponding decision variables are 
# multiplied by the appropriate number of points (1000, 100, 10 or 1) and added to 
# the objective_function_parts list. When the list is done being assembled, we set 
# the objective function by running lpSum on the list. Note that with this objective 
# function, there is no preference on _when_ a student does a preferred activity. 
# For example, the same number of points are rewarded whether the student does their
# first choice activity in the first period or the last period.
objective_function_parts = []
for decision_vars in decision_vars_list:
    for i in range(NUM_STUDENTS):
        choice1, choice2, choice3, choice4 = student_info_dicts[i]['choices']

        objective_function_parts.append([decision_vars[(i, choice2)]*100])
        objective_function_parts.append([decision_vars[(i, choice3)]*10])
        objective_function_parts.append([decision_vars[(i, choice4)]*1])

prob += pulp.lpSum(objective_function_parts)

# STEP 7: SOLVE THE LP
#------------------------------------------------------
solution_found = prob.solve()

# check that a solution was found (anything other than solution_found == 1 
# indicates some issue with finding a solution that fits constraints)
assert solution_found == 1, "solution not found"
print("Objective value:", pulp.value(prob.objective))

# STEP 8: EXTRACT THE SOLUTION INTO A USEFUL FORMAT
#------------------------------------------------------

# it, we'll collect some data to see how we did
